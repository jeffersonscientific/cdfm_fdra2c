hmmvpCompress key_value_file
  'key_value_file' contains the following fields:

  'allow_overwrite' (optional) says whether write_(hd_/hmat_)filename can be
    overwritten. If it is not provided, then overwrite of these files is not
    allowed.

  'do_extra_tasks_only' (optional) says whether to call ImplGreensFn::DoExtras()
    only and exit.

  'write_hd_filename', 'use_hd_filename': Optionally, use one of these two
    keys. Use the first to save the decomposition after it is computed. Use the
    second to use a saved decomposition rather than computing a new one.

  'write_hmat_filename' is the name of the file into which the H-matrix should
    be written.

  'use_hmat_filename' is optionally an old H-matrix file for the same problem
    that can be used to speed up constructing this one.

  'tol' specifies the approximation error:
      ||B_approx - B||_F <= tol ||B||_F.

  'Bfro' optionally is an estimate of ||B||_F that should be used instead of the
    internally generated estimate.

  'greens_fn' is a string indicating which Green's function class to use. A GF
    class may require more key-value pairs. Currently available GFs are these:

      'inverse-r': This is for testing. Provide these key-value pairs:
        'X': 3xN array of points.
        'order': 0, 1, 2, 3.
        'delta': Plummer softening parameter.

      'okada-rect-tensor-mesh':
        'x', 'eta': x is an (ns+1)-vector of along-strike cell edges. eta is an
          (nd+1)-vector of along-dip cell edges. The mesh is a tensor- product
          mesh. The coordinate system is in the plane of the fault. Fast index
          is along strike from x(1) to x(end) and eta(1) to eta(end).
        'depth_min': Minimum depth of fault.
        'dipdeg': Dipping angle of the fault in degrees.
        'mu', 'nu': Lame parameters.
        'disl_strike', 'disl_dip, 'disl_tensile': As in Okada's routine dc3d.
        'component': Component to compute [optiona; default 1]:
          0 - along strike, 1 - along dip, 2 - normal.
        'bc_filename': File in which to store N binary double-precision numbers,
          ordered as above, containing the velocity boundary condition data. The
          BC is that the medium on all sides except the updip one slide in the
          direction of 'component'.
        As a hint, a subducting fault going to the surface, with eta=0 on the
        updip end, is specified with dipdeg < 0, depth_min = 0. disl_dip > 0 is
        a dislocation in the +eta direction.

      'okada-subduct-symm-rect-periodic-tensor-mesh':
        'x', 'eta': x is an (ns/2+1)-vector of along-strike cell edges. x(1) =
          0, and the full fault is given by [x(end:-1:2) x(1:end)]. eta is an
          (nd+1)-vector of along-dip cell edges. The mesh is a tensor- product
          mesh. The coordinate system is in the plane of the fault. Fast index
          is along strike from x(1) to x(end) and eta(1) to eta(end). Let N =
          (ns/2)*nd.
        'mu', 'nu': Lame parameters.
        'depth_min': Minimum depth of fault.
        'dipdeg': Dipping angle of the fault in degrees.
        'nrepeat': Number of repeat images in each strike direction.
        'bc_filename': File in which to store N binary double-precision numbers,
          ordered as above, containing the velocity boundary condition data from
          the down-dip end.

      'okada-subduct-symm-rect-periodic-quad-mesh':
        'rmesh_filename': RectUnstructMesh file.
        'mu', 'nu': Lame parameters.
        'depth_min': Minimum depth of fault.
        'dipdeg': Dipping angle of the fault in degrees.
        'nrepeat': Number of repeat images in each strike direction.
        'bc_filename': File in which to store N binary double-precision numbers,
          ordered as above, containing the velocity boundary condition data from
          the down-dip end.
