i think i want the release package to look like this:
    src/
      util/include
          /src
          /matlab
      hmmvp/...
      dc3dm/...
      external/
        dc3omp.f

    include/
      Hmat.hpp

    bin/
      dc3dmMesh
      dc3dmBuild
      dc3dmCompress
      dc3dmMvpEx

    matlab/
      hm_mvp.mex
      dc3dm_mex.mex
      dc3dm.m
      ex.m

    Makefile
    make.m
    readme.txt


  - mv dc3dm code to code/dc3dm, including Rect*, Brick*, etc.
  - write a python program to make the release package. put license headers in
    all files.
  - i want include and matlab dirs to be as clean as possible.


i'll separately release hmmvp, but for that i think i'll take the monolithic
approach. i'm not that concerned about handholding there because anybody who
wants to use hmmvp will be an experienced enough programmer to handle at least a
monolithic build.
